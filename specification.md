# Specification

## info.json

`info.json` contains JSON object with two fields: "version" and "libraries".  

Field "version" contains version of the current package generated by `cpack`.  
Field "libraries" contains the list of all libraries as JSON objects. 
Every JSON object inside of the list should have the following fields:
 * `name` - name of the library
 * `version` - version of the library in any format
 * `env` - list of environments in which this library is present
 * `include` - list of files which are added to the `include` directory in every environment
 * `lib` - list of files which are added to the `lib` directory in every environment

For example:
```json
{
  "version": "<package version>",
  "libraries": [
    {
      "name": "<library name>",
      "version": "<library version>",
      "env": [ "env1", "env2" ],
      "include": [ "header1.h", "header2.h" ],
      "lib": [ "lib1.so", "lib2.a" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## remote.json

`remote.json` contains JSON object with 2 fields: "host" and "key" (optional).

Field "host" contains URL to the remote HTTP resource on which packages are stored.  
Field "key" is optional and contains user key which gives users write or read access to the remote storage.

For example:
```json
{
  "host": "https://remote-repository.com:9090",
  "key": "<private key to manage that repository>"
}
```
